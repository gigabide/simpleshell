# simpleshell
A simple shell written in C as a school project. It takes a few verbs as 'shell' commands and executes bash equivalent commands.
I'll be updating this sometime in the near future to include proper parsing of arguments out of the command string.
The goal of this assignment was to understand how we can use C to make system calls that control processes, such as fork(), and exec().
